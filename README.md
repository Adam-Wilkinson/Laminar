Project: Laminar is an open-source, cross-platform, plugin based automation framework, built to take your PC usage to the next level. From scheduling events throughout the day, to making complex macros to control your computer with your keyboard, and even turning your smart lights red whenever you get a work email, Laminar offers you total control.

This is the source code of Project: Laminar. We are currently under development and the documentation isn't complete, but if you want to make a plugin there are plenty of examples under src/Plugins to browse and learn from.
